### Revised Plan with C++ and Local Storage
Build a web app with a chess engine where the players are two LLMs, use Langchain to call the llms and build a chess engine. Provide the rules of chess as context for both llms. Make sure the chess engine is comprehensive of rules and scoring system.

The programming lanuages should be TypeScript and C++.

### Programming Languages and Tools

1. **C++**: For implementing the chess engine, LLM interaction logic, and backend functionalities.
2. **TypeScript/JavaScript**: For building the frontend (e.g., React or Next.js).
3. **HTML/CSS**: For styling and structuring the UI.
4. **Local Storage Tools**:
   - **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based database for storing game data and logs locally.
   - **Filesystem (C++ `std::filesystem`)**: For storing game logs as flat files (e.g., JSON or CSV).

---

### Updated Plan

#### **Phase 1: Planning and Research**
1. **Define Features**:
   - Same as the original plan:
     - Two LLMs as players.
     - Comprehensive chess engine with rules and scoring.
     - Real-time game visualization.
     - Local storage of game data (using SQLite or files).

2. **C++ Tools and Libraries**:
   - **Chess Engine**: Create a custom chess engine using C++ or adapt an open-source chess library like [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) or [Chess.cpp](https://github.com/careercup/C-plus-plus-chess).
   - **SQLite**: Use SQLite for managing local storage of game data.
   - **LLM Integration**:
     - Use LangChain (Python bridge with C++ wrapper) or directly integrate with the LLM API via HTTP requests.

3. **Design Chess Rule Context**:
   - Same as the original plan:
     - Include all movement rules, special moves, and scoring systems.
     - Write clear prompts for LLMs about chess rules.

---

#### **Phase 2: Backend Development (C++)**

1. **Chess Engine**:
   - Develop the engine to handle:
     - Board representation (e.g., 2D array or bitboards for efficiency).
     - Move generation and validation (including castling, en passant, and promotion).
     - Game state evaluation (check, checkmate, stalemate).
     - Scoring system:
       - Material evaluation (e.g., pawn = 1, queen = 9).
       - Positional evaluation (e.g., piece activity and board control).

2. **LLM Interaction**:
   - Implement HTTP requests from C++ to interact with LLM APIs.
   - Use libraries like `libcurl` or `Boost.Beast` for making API calls.
   - Format the current game state and send it to the LLM as part of the prompt.
   - Parse the LLM's response to extract the suggested move.

3. **Local Storage**:
   - **SQLite**:
     - Create a database schema to store:
       - Game states.
       - Player IDs (LLMs used).
       - Move history with timestamps.
       - Scores and outcomes.
   - **Flat Files** (Alternative):
     - Store game data as JSON or CSV files in a directory.
     - Use `std::fstream` or `nlohmann/json` (for JSON parsing) to handle files.

4. **API Layer**:
   - Use C++ web frameworks like **Drogon** or **Crow** to create REST APIs:
     - `/start-game`: Initialize a new game and store its state.
     - `/make-move`: Accept moves from LLMs, validate them, and update the board state.
     - `/get-game-log`: Retrieve move history and scores.

---

#### **Phase 3: Frontend Development**

1. **Chessboard Interface**:
   - Use `react-chessboard` or a similar library to render the chessboard.
   - Communicate with the C++ backend using REST APIs.
   - Display move highlights, captured pieces, and game status.

2. **Game Controls**:
   - Allow users to start, pause, or reset games.
   - Provide options to select LLMs for the game.

3. **Game Logs and Scoring**:
   - Show move history and scores in a table or sidebar.
   - Display real-time positional evaluations from the backend.

---

#### **Phase 4: Testing**

1. **Unit Testing (C++)**:
   - Test the chess engine for:
     - Correctness of moves.
     - Handling of edge cases (e.g., stalemate, draw by repetition).
     - Scoring accuracy.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Ensure seamless communication between the chess engine, LLM API, and frontend.

3. **Frontend Testing**:
   - Verify the responsiveness and usability of the web interface.
   - Test real-time updates of the chessboard.

---

#### **Phase 5: Deployment**

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Run the C++ backend as a standalone server on the local machine or a cloud instance.
   - Ensure SQLite database is accessible from the backend.

2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Host the frontend locally or on a simple static server (e.g., with `npm run build` for Next.js).

3. **Local Storage Management**:
   - Ensure SQLite files or JSON logs are stored in an accessible, persistent directory.

---

#### **Optional Features for Future Iterations**
1. **Customizable LLM Context**:
   - Allow users to modify the chess rules or strategies provided to the LLMs.

2. **Visualization Enhancements**:
   - Add animations for piece movements.
   - Show heatmaps for positional evaluations.

3. **Game Analysis**:
   - Integrate post-game analysis directly into the frontend using the chess engine.

4. **Advanced Local Storage**:
   - Add support for archiving old games or exporting logs.
